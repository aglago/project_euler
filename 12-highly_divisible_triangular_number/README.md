## Problem Description

The problem involves finding the value of the first triangle number that has over 500 divisors. To understand the problem, let's consider an example.

The sequence of triangle numbers is generated by adding the natural numbers. The 7th triangle number is 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 = 28. Your task is to find the first triangle number that has over 500 divisors.
