Problem 6: Sum Square Difference

Problem Description

The problem involves finding the difference between the sum of squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

The sum of the squares of the first ten natural numbers is calculated as follows:

1^2 + 2^2 + ... + 10^2 = 385

The square of the sum of the first ten natural numbers is calculated as follows:

(1 + 2 + ... + 10)^2 = 55^2 = 3025

Hence, the difference between the sum of the squares and the square of the sum for the first ten natural numbers is 3025 - 385 = 2640.

Your task is to find the difference between the sum of the squares of the first one hundred natural numbers and the square of the sum.

Example

Given that the difference between the sum of the squares and the square of the sum for the first ten natural numbers is 2640, we need to find the difference for the first one hundred natural numbers.

Approach

To solve this problem, we can use a mathematical formula that directly calculates the sum of squares and the square of the sum.

The sum of squares of the first n natural numbers can be calculated using the formula:

sum_of_squares = n * (n + 1) * (2n + 1) / 6

The square of the sum of the first n natural numbers can be calculated using the formula:

square_of_sum = (n * (n + 1) / 2)^2

The difference between the sum of squares and the square of the sum can be computed by subtracting the sum_of_squares from the square_of_sum.
