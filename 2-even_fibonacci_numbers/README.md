# Fibonacci Sequence - Sum of Even-Valued Terms

## Problem Description

Each new term in the [Fibonacci sequence](https://www.google.com/search?q=Fibonacci%20sequence) is generated by adding the previous two terms. By starting with 1 and 2, the first n terms will be: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89...

By considering the terms in the [Fibonacci sequence](https://www.google.com/search?q=Fibonacci%20sequence) whose values do not exceed four million, find the sum of the even-valued terms.

## Algorithm

1. [Fibonacci](https://www.google.com/search?q=Fibonacci) starts with 1 and 2.
2. [Fibonacci](https://www.google.com/search?q=Fibonacci) terms should not exceed 4 million.
3. Find the sum of even-valued terms.

## C Solution

The C solution to this problem can be found in [solution.c](./solution.c) file. It includes a `fib` function to calculate the [Fibonacci sequence](https://www.google.com/search?q=Fibonacci%20sequence) and an `even_sum` function to find the sum of even-valued terms. The main function calls the `even_sum` function and prints the result.

## JavaScript Solution

The JavaScript solution to this problem can be found in [solution.js](./solution.js) file. It includes a `fib` function to calculate the [Fibonacci sequence](https://www.google.com/search?q=Fibonacci%20sequence) and an `even_sum` function to find the sum of even-valued terms. The script calls the `even_sum` function and logs the result to the console.
