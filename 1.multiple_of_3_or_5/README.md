# Project Euler Problem 1

This repository contains my solution and description for [Project Euler Problem 1](https://projecteuler.net/problem=1).

## Problem Description

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6, and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Find the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

## Solution

To solve this problem, we can iterate through all the numbers below 1000 and check if each number is divisible by 3 or 5. If it is, we add it to a running sum. Finally, we return the sum as the solution to the problem.

## Usage

To run the solution for this problem, you can follow these steps:

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the project in your preferred programming environment.
3. Navigate to the directory for Problem 1.
4. Run the program or script that contains the solution code.
5. The program will output the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below 1000.

Feel free to modify the solution code or use it as a reference to come up with your own solution.
